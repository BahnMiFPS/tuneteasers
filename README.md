<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement the ability for users to filter multiple music categories for a more customized quiz experience.
- [ ] Enhance user experience by implementing persistent user sessions to allow for seamless continuation of gameplay across sessions.
- [ ] Reduce reliance on the Spotify API by integrating additional music sources or expanding the existing database of questions.
- [ ] Implement scaling strategies to handle increased traffic and user load:
  - [ ] Explore running socket.io on multiple Node instances to improve performance and handle a higher number of concurrent connections.
  - [ ] Replace the default in-memory adapter with a Redis adapter or another compatible adapter to enable better scalability and handling of large amounts of data.

Please refer to the [open issues](https://github.com/BahnMiFPS/tuneteasers/issues) for a complete list of proposed features, bug fixes, and known issues.
